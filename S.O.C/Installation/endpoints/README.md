## Overview

To ensure full functionality and protection of our Security Operations Center (S.O.C.) endpoints, the following three tools must be installed:

1. **Suricata**
2. **Filebeat**
3. **Fleetd Agent**

Within this document, you will find the installation processes for these tools, applicable to both Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Purpose of Each Tool

### Suricata

Suricata is a high-performance network IDS, IPS, and network security monitoring engine. It is capable of real-time intrusion detection and prevention. The key roles of Suricata are:

### Filebeat

Filebeat is a lightweight shipper for forwarding and centralizing log data. Installed as an agent on your servers, Filebeat monitors the log files or locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them to the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, etc.). Its key roles include:

- Collecting logs generated by Suricata
- Sending the collected logs to the SIEM for analysis

### Fleetd Agent

Fleetd Agent is part of the Elastic Agent system that allows for centralized management and monitoring of endpoints. It serves the following purposes:

- Interrogating endpoints for potential threats
- Registering the endpoint with the EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tool of the S.O.C.
