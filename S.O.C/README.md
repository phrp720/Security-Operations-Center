## Server Setup

First, we need to set up the server where the SOC will be installed.

Follow the steps and phases located [here](./Installation/server/README.md) to set up the server.

After completing the server setup, proceed to the next section to register and protect the endpoints.

## Endpoints Setup

The next step is to set up the endpoints that will be monitored by the SOC. We have two types of endpoints: Windows and Linux.

### Windows Installation

For Windows endpoint setup, follow the instructions located [here](./Installation/endpoints/windows/README.md).

### Linux Installation

For Linux endpoint setup, follow the instructions located [here](./Installation/endpoints/linux/README.md).
